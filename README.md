# MacPack
MacPack is a packaging and installation system for macOS apps using a custom .mpb (MacPack Bundle) format. It lets developers package their applications — including executables, assets, and metadata — into self-contained bundles. MacPack supports interpreted, compiled, and JIT-compiled apps, and includes a runtime (MPR) to run the bundles. It also features support for both open-source and closed-source distribution with its .mpbs (MacPack Bundled Source) system.
